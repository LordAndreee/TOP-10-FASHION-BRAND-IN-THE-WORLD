<br>Chanel is a brand with a legacy etched in fashion history. Some of its iconic designs include the little black dress, Chanel No. 5 perfume, Chanel 2.55 bag, tweed outfits, pearl necklaces, and ballet flats. Coco Chanel, a legendary designer, revolutionized women’s fashion by introducing shoulder bags and yachting pants over 100 years ago. Her goal was to create more comfortable, masculine clothing that did not require corsets.<br><br>Building on Coco’s legacy, Karl Lagerfeld modernized her original designs in the ’80s and reintroduced them, leveraging Chanel’s heritage and brand elements into new designs like the interlocking CC logo on belts and pearl jewelry, mixing tweed with grunge style. This strategy saved Chanel from financial ruin.<br>Exclusivity, value-based marketing, and legacy are some of the key factors that have made Chanel a $13.2 billion (about $41 per person in the US) brand. Chanel has been successful in maintaining its position in the luxury fashion market through its heritage designs, attention to detail, and the unique experiences that it offers to its customers. The brand’s commitment to quality and exclusivity has created a loyal following among fashion-conscious consumers who appreciate the brand’s rich history and iconic designs,<br><br>The House of Chanel originated in 1909, when Gabrielle Chanel opened a millinery shop at 160 Boulevard Malesherbes, the ground floor of the Parisian flat of the socialite and textile businessman Étienne Balsan, of whom she was the mistress. Because the Balsan flat also was a salon for the French hunting and sporting élite, Chanel had the opportunity to meet their demi-mondaine mistresses who, as such, were women of fashion, upon whom the rich men displayed their wealth – as ornate clothes, jewellery, and hats.<br><br>The actress Gabrielle Dorziat wearing a Chanel plumed hat (1912)<br>Coco Chanel thus could sell to them the hats she designed and made; she thus earned a living independent of Balsan. In the course of those salons, Coco Chanel befriended Arthur "Boy" Capel, an English socialite and polo player friend of Étienne Balsan; per the upper class social custom, Chanel also became mistress to Boy Capel. In 1910, Boy Capel financed her first independent millinery shop, Chanel Modes, at 21 rue Cambon in Paris. Because that locale already housed a dress shop, the business-lease limited Chanel to selling only millinery products, not couture. Two years later 1913, the Deauville and Biarritz couture shops of Coco Chanel offered for sale prêt-à-porter sports clothes for women, the practical designs of which allowed the wearer to play sports.

The iconic Hermès brand is known for its luxurious and exclusive bags, such as the famous Birkin and Kelly bags. These bags have become a status symbol, with their resale value being 10 times that of gold, and their acquisition considered a sign of having “made it.” Hermès employs unique marketing tactics to maintain its prestige, such as word-of-mouth and exclusivity, as well as naming bags after famous celebrities like Grace Kelly and Jane Birkin.<br><br>The brand limits the production of these bags and keeps the numbers crafted each year a closely guarded secret, creating an air of scarcity around their products.

Cartier, founded in 1847 by Louis-Francois Cartier, started as a shop in Paris. Over the years, Cartier has served as crown jewelers for 19 royal families. King Edward VII of Great Britain referred to Cartier as “the jeweler of kings and the king of jewelers.” Cartier made jewelry and watches for history’s biggest names. It was Louis’s 3 grandsons, Pierre the great salesman, Jacques the gem expert and Louis the creative mind who made Cartier the biggest jewelry firm.br<><br>The family followed a very simple logic to succeed. During the siege of Paris, Cartier bought jewelry from Parisian courtiers at a bargain and sold them to English aristocrats. When wealthy Russians were exiled after world war I, Cartier bought their jewels and sold them to newly rich Americans. And when the great depression hit America, Cartier was selling jewelry to Maharajas of India. This simple yet effective strategy helped Cartier become one of the most prominent names in luxury jewelry.<br><br> Cartier is also known for its iconic panther motif, which was introduced in 1914 and has since become a symbol of the brand. Today, Cartier is owned by the Richemont group and continues to be one of the most prestigious names in luxury jewelry, with a focus on quality craftsmanship and timeless design.<br><br>Cartier International SNC, or simply Cartier (/ˈkɑːrtieɪ/ KAR-tee-ay, French: [kaʁtje]), is a French luxury-goods conglomerate that designs, manufactures, distributes, and sells jewelry, watches, leather goods, sunglasses and eyeglasses. Founded by Louis-François Cartier (1819–1904) in Paris in 1847, the company remained under family control until 1964.The company is headquartered in Paris, France, and is currently a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont Group, a global luxury giant.[citation needed] Cartier operates more than 200 stores in 125 countries, with three Temples (Historical Maisons) in Paris, London, and New York City.Cartier is regarded as one of the most prestigious luxury-goods manufacturers.Forbes ranked Cartier on its Most Valuable Brands list as 56th in 2020, with a brand value of $12.2 B and revenue of $6.2 B.Cartier has a long history of sales to royalty.[13] King Edward VII referred to Cartier as "the jeweller of kings and the king of jewellers".For his coronation in 1902, Edward VII ordered 27 tiaras and issued a royal warrant to Cartier in 1904.Similar warrants soon followed from the courts of Spain, Portugal, Serbia, Russia and the House of Orléans. The largest ever single order to date was made in 1925 by the Indian royalty, the Maharaja of Patiala, for the Patiala Necklace and other jewelry worth ₹1 billion (equivalent to ₹210 billion, US$2.6 billion or €2.6 billion in 2023).

Balenciaga was founded by Cristóbal Balenciaga, a legendary couturier who was revered by fashion icons like Coco Chanel and Christian Dior. Today, Balenciaga is owned by the Kering group, which also owns other luxury fashion brands such as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen.<br><br>After Cristóbal’s death in 1972, Balenciaga lost some of its former glory. However, in 2015, Demna Gvasalia took over as creative director and transformed the brand’s image from haute couture to streetwear. This shift proved to be a huge success with Balenciaga’s “sock sneakers” and “platform crocs” dominating the luxury footwear market.<br><br>Despite returning to haute couture after 53 years, Balenciaga is also moving fast into another untapped market – E-sports. The brand has collaborated with Fortnite to launch skins and virtual clothes, and even released its fall ’21 collection via an interactive game. Balenciaga is embracing digital fashion as the future and continues to push boundaries in the industry.<br><br>  Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebastián, Spain, in 1919, and expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and aristocracy wore his designs. When the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, he moved to Paris.<br><br>Balenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August 1937, where his first fashion show featured designs heavily influenced by the Spanish Renaissance. His success was nearly immediate. In two years, the press lauded him as a revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after.[4] Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, was an early champion of his designs.<br><br>Historians believe that Balenciaga's continued activity during the Nazi occupation of Paris was made possible by his connections with Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco who was Adolf Hitler's close ally. The relation to Franco was so close that Balenciaga designed clothing for the Franco family. The company was one of only 60 allowed to operate during the occupation, and the ongoing supply of raw materials from Spain, which were in short supply in Paris due to the war, gave Balenciaga a competitive advantage. However, he testified that he refused Hitler's request to transfer his company's activities to Berlin.<br><br>During the post-war years, his lines became more linear and sleek, diverging from the hourglass shape popularized by "Christian Dior's New Look". The fluidity of his silhouettes enabled him to manipulate the relationship between his clothing and women's bodies. In 1951, he transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1958. Other contributions in the postwar era included the spherical balloon jacket (1953), the high-waisted baby doll dress (1957), the cocoon coat (1957), the balloon skirt (1957), and the sack dress (1957). In 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimono. His manipulation of the waist, in particular, constituted "what is considered to be his most important contribution to the world of fashion: a new silhouette for women".<br><br>In the 1960s, Balenciaga tended toward heavy fabrics, intricate embroidery, and bold materials.His trademarks included "collars that stood away from the collarbone to give a swanlike appearance" and shortened "bracelet" sleeves. His often spare, sculptural creations—including funnel-shape gowns of stiff duchess satin worn to acclaim by clients such as Pauline de Rothschild, Bunny Mellon, Marella Agnelli, Hope Portocarrero, Gloria Guinness, and Mona von Bismarck—were considered masterworks of haute couture in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1960, he designed the wedding dress for Queen Fabiola of Belgium made of ivory duchess satin trimmed with white mink at the collar and the hips. Jackie Kennedy famously upset her husband by buying Balenciaga's expensive creations while John F. Kennedy was president – he apparently feared that the American public might think the purchases too lavish. Her haute couture bills were eventually discreetly paid by her father-in-law, Joseph Kennedy.
